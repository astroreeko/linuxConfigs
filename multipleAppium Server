For multiple android devices start your appium server with parameters:

    node appium.js -p 4476 -U <device1_serial>
    node appium.js -p 4475 -U <device2_serial>

You can select any port, but make sure they are different in your code, where you are creating driver, provide server url:

server1_url = "http://127.0.0.1:4475/wd/hub"
server2_url = "http://127.0.0.1:4476/wd/hub"

Done.
